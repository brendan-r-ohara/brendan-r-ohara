        <p>
            As a student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science with a specialization in Environmental Policy at the University of South Florida, I have engaged in a diverse range of coursework designed to equip me with the knowledge and skills necessary to address pressing environmental challenges. In addition to foundational courses in Environmental Law and Policy Analysis, I have delved into topics such as Sustainable Development and Climate Science. These experiences have deepened my understanding of the complex interactions between human activities and the environment, fueling my passion for advocating for evidence-based policy solutions. Combined with my previous academic achievements, including an Associate of Arts in Biology from St. Petersburg College, I am well-prepared to contribute meaningfully to the field of environmental science and policy.

### Key Changes
- **Consistent Background Color**: The background is set to white to avoid unwanted color changes.
- **Increased Image Size**: The `max-width` is set to 400px, providing more space for the image while keeping its aspect ratio intact with `object-fit: cover`.
- **Responsive Design**: The CSS includes adjustments for smaller screens to ensure the image remains centered without overlapping the text.
- **Proper Margins and Padding**: Consistent spacing to maintain a clean and readable layout.

With these changes, the code should provide a better layout with a larger, properly positioned image, avoiding any unexpected color changes or text overlaps. If you need further adjustments or assistance, I'm here to help.
